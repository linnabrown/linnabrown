- ðŸ”­ I am currently a 3rd-Year Computional Biology Ph.D. student, working at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for Data science in human genetics. 

- ðŸŒ± My research interests span the fields of **human genetics**, especially in **genetic variants and Hi-C analysis** (i.e., sequencing enhancement, loop calling) and **metagenomics** (i.e. CAZyme profiling, database and server developing). 

- ðŸ‘¯ Seeking for collaboration in such fields. Feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:lehuang@unc.edu?subject=intention of cooperation from [name]-[title]-[institute]">Email</a>
